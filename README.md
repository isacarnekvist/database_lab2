# Database lab 2
This is a shipping service for things bought on blocket, ebay, ... The company holds payment as escrow until buyer recieves
a package and is satisfyed.

## Known bugs
The site doesn't handle contracts added to a non-existing buyer id. Probably a lot more since the purpose mainly is constructing a simple database and a simple GUI that issues queries.
